## popgenstuff README

This repo contains an R package with frequently used popgen functions 
in the [Bradburd Lab](genescape.org).

## Installation

```r
	library(devtools)
	install_github("gbradburd/popgenstuff")
```

## Caveats

The functions within have not undergone peer-review 
and are not associated with any manuscript.
They're just functions that we found ourselves using 
a lot and have therefore decided to package up for convenience. 
If you spot a bug, please let us know by opening an issue.
If you'd like to contribute, that'd be great!
